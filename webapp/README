HOW TO INSTALL
===============

This is a pretty straightforward rails app. You'll need a few gems,

   gem install sanitize
   port install imagemagick
   gem install json-pure
   gem install paperclip

Setup your database as usual,

   su - pgsql
   createuser -P imagewiki imagewiki
   createdb -O imagewiki imagewiki

And, to actually run it,

   rake db:migrate
   script/server start

And then to see it go here in your browser

   http://localhost:3000
