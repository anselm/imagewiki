======
About
======

An open source BSD licensed image comparison project from the makerlab.
See http://imagewiki.org and http://makerlab.com / http://makerlab.org

This repository is a migration of our existing code from svn.makerlab.org .

We are switching to github because we think it is better.

Also this is a code rewrite into merb from rails.

Please feel free to support us or provide feedback.  You can email me at:

============
Contents
============

/webapp - a version in ruby on rails that was started feb 2010
          a work in progress - don't use

/website - this is the merb site itself
          currently this is a vanilla mvc pattern
          we'll probably use merb slices later

/engine - this is a standalone c based comparator engine
          it uses the sift algorithm and features a scaleable datastore

/iphone - this is the iphone client; a native client for the iphone
          it is based on iflickr.

INSTALLATION
============

0) There are some hard coded paths in app/models/note.rb - see the %x[convert] and the like - these are externalized at the moment - you have to change them for your hardware.

1) Merb is slightly less unstable - see "gem_list.txt" for a list of gems.
   I suggest using passenger phusion now.

2) Merb has ever changing ways of doing migrations:

   cd website
   rake MERB_ENV=development db:automigrate

3) To run the merb side do this:

   cd website
   merb >& merb_logging_file.log &

4) There is a C/C++ standalone engine you must also run - here is the incantation for building and running it - you need to build opencv first among other things:

   echo "setting the pkg config path is so important btw"

   setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
   cd engine/src
   configure 
   make
   cd ../..
   engine/src/db-add image.db test.jpg testlabel
   engine/src/db-server 4444 image.db >& engine_logging_file.log &

5) There was an iphone client - it has a makefile also - see the iphone folder.  Now it is obsolete and needs to be moved to the latest version of the iphone - anybody want to do that?

6) Note that the db ip port is hard coded in app/models/note.rb to be 4444
