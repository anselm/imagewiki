This is a migration of iFlickr to serve our needs.

It preserves the auth support because perhaps later we may use it for flickr.

The whole thing may just go away in fact and we can stick with iFlickr or a very small mod to iflickr to dump you over to the imagewiki website where it could do a lookup against a specific flickr post...
